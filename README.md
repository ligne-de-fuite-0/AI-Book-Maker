# KBook - AI Book Maker

KBook is an innovative web application powered by the Google Gemini API, designed to assist users in creating complete books. From generating a comprehensive outline and a captivating title to writing individual chapters, KBook streamlines the book creation process with advanced AI capabilities.

## Features

-   **AI-Powered Book Outline Generation**: Provide a subject, language, desired number of chapters, and additional instructions to get a structured book outline in JSON format.
-   **AI-Powered Book Title Generation**: Generates an attractive and relevant book title (7-25 words) based on the subject and the generated outline.
-   **Automated & Streamed Chapter Content**:
    -   **Streaming Output**: Watch chapters being written in real-time.
    -   **Automated Generation**: Chapters are generated sequentially without manual intervention for each section.
    -   **Contextual Writing**: The AI considers the full book structure and previously written chapters for better coherence.
-   **Rich Customization Options**:
    -   **Language**: Select from multiple languages for book generation.
    -   **Generation Mode**:
        -   `Normal Mode` (uses `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17`): Faster generation, good quality.
        -   `Advanced Mode` (uses `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-06-05`): Slower, potentially higher quality for more nuanced content.
    -   **Number of Chapters**: Adjust the desired number of chapters using a slider (range: 6-20, default: 12).
    -   **Chapter Length**: Adjust the approximate word count for chapters using a slider control (default: 7000 words, range: 200-20000 words).
    -   **Reading Level**: Select from descriptive levels (e.g., Kindergarten, Middle School, Standard, Adult, High School, College, Graduate School) or customize on a 1-10 numerical scale using a modal.
-   **Interactive UI & Workflow**:
    -   **Step-by-Step Process**: Guided workflow from initial input to final book view.
    -   **Progress Bar**: Visually track your progress through the book creation stages.
    -   **Outline Review**: Review and approve the generated title and structure before proceeding.
    -   **Chapter Generation View**: Monitor the automated writing process with per-chapter status and streamed content.
-   **Export Options**:
    -   **Copy to Clipboard**: Copy the entire book (title + chapters) in Markdown format.
    -   **Download .txt**: Download the book as a plain text file, with content formatted in Markdown.
-   **Responsive Design**: User-friendly interface accessible on various devices.
-   **Error Handling**: Provides feedback for API key issues or generation errors.

## Tech Stack

-   **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
-   **AI**: Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`)
-   **Module Loading**: ES Modules directly in the browser via import maps (no build step required for basic operation).

## Prerequisites

1.  **Web Browser**: A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
2.  **Google Gemini API Key**: You **must** have a valid API key for the Google Gemini API.
    -   You can obtain one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

## Setup and Running

KBook is designed to run directly in the browser without a complex build process.

**1. API Key Configuration:**

   The application exclusively obtains the Gemini API key from the environment variable `process.env.API_KEY`. This variable **must be pre-configured, valid, and accessible** in the execution context where the application is run.

   *   **For Local Development/Testing:** Since this is a client-side application without a Node.js backend to easily manage `process.env`, you'll need to ensure this variable is available to `index.html`.
        *   One common way to test applications that expect `process.env` variables locally is to use a simple development server that can inject environment variables or serve files with headers.
        *   Alternatively, for quick local testing **ONLY** (and **NEVER** for deployment or committing to version control), you could temporarily modify `services/geminiService.ts`:
            ```javascript
            // Near the top of services/geminiService.ts
            // const API_KEY = process.env.API_KEY; 
            const API_KEY = "YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE"; // TEMPORARY for local testing
            ```
            **Warning**: If you do this, remember to revert the change before committing any code. The application is built to rely on `process.env.API_KEY` being defined in its true execution environment.

**2. Running the Application:**

   -   Ensure all project files (`index.html`, `index.tsx`, `App.tsx`, `components/`, `services/`, `types.ts`, `constants.ts`, `metadata.json`) are in the same directory structure as provided.
   -   Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
     *   You might need to serve the files using a simple local HTTP server if your browser has strict security policies regarding `file:///` origins for module loading or other features. Python's `http.server` or Node.js `http-server` can be used:
        ```bash
        # Using Python
        python -m http.server
        # Using Node.js http-server (install with: npm install -g http-server)
        http-server .
        ```
        Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the port shown by the server).
